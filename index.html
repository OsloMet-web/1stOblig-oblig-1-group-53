<p class="pHome">Imagine that three years from now, you have finished your degree at OsloMet and have just been recruited
    to one of the largest consultancy firms in Norway. In the first week in your new position, you are told by
    your supervisor that, in addition to your individual tasks, you will be working with a small team of 5-6
    people, who regularly meet to discuss and find good balanced solutions to complex situations and problems
    within the company or society in general.</p>
